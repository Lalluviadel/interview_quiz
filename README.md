# interview_quiz
The simple website for theory training.

After registration, you can perform tests with questions of the required level of complexity to train different areas of knowledge.
The questions for each test are selected in a pseudo-random way.
In addition to questions, there are short posts on the site for a better understanding of the topic.
Any user can offer their question, post or write to the staff. 
For the convenience of moderating the site, there is its own admin panel.
