"""
The **posts** package is designed to implement an additional mechanism of the project:
small articles that supplement theoretical knowledge or briefly disclose the topic of the issue.

I decided to call *posts* these small articles within the framework of the project,
since they have too small a volume for an article. Rather, these are small notes
than a full-fledged training text.
